High-Level Test Automation Strategy
API-Driven Validation:

Validate all business logic through API tests.

Swagger-Driven Development for APIs:

Utilize Swagger to define and document APIs.

Generate automated API tests from Swagger definitions.

UI Automation:

Identify and prioritize critical E2E flows.

Focus only on critical E2E flows, minimizing unnecessary UI automation.

Ensure UI automation targets essential user interactions.

Test Data Strategy:

Prefer API/DB setup over UI-based data creation.

Implement automated cleanup scripts to avoid flaky tests.

Run Tests in CI Pipeline:

Integrate API and UI tests into the CI pipeline for faster feedback.

Tools
Playwright for UI Automation:

Playwright will be our primary tool for UI automation due to its support for multiple browser contexts and its comprehensive testing capabilities.

API Testing:

Playwright offers basic API testing capabilities, which can be useful for initial validation and simple API tests.

For more advanced API testing, we will use Rest Assured, which is a robust and mature library for API testing in the Java ecosystem.
