High-Level Test Automation Strategy
API Test Validation:

Validate all business logic through API tests using Rest Assured or Playwright.

Swagger-Driven Development for APIs:

Utilize Swagger/OpenAPI to define and document APIs.

Generate automated API tests from Swagger definitions.

Use mock services and server stubs.

Integrate API tests into CI/CD pipeline.

Maintain versioned API documentation.

Critical E2E Flows:

Identify and prioritize critical E2E flows.

Minimize UI automation, focusing on essential user interactions.

Test Data Strategy:

Prefer API/DB setup over UI-based data creation.

Implement automated cleanup scripts to avoid flaky tests.

Run API Tests in CI Pipeline:

Integrate API tests into the CI pipeline for faster feedback.

Configure parallel test execution.

Generate detailed test reports and set up alerts.

UI Automation with Playwright or Selenium:

Playwright preferred for its support for multiple browser contexts in a single test.

Layered Testing Approach (excluding unit tests):

Combine integration tests and E2E tests.

Ensure each layer covers different aspects of the application without including unit tests.
